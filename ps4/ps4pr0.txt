PS 4: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.
1. Kurzweil views technology as a fundamentally positive force in human development. Is his vision of the future one that you would look forward to? Why or why not?
2. Kurzweil has a track record of remarkable inventions and successful predictions. Do you believe the predictions cited in this article? Why or why not?
Kurzweil views technology as something that will be beneficial to humanity in that it would make us “better, smarter, and fitter”. I don’t agree that his vision of the future is one to look forward to because I feel like technology would detract more than it would give. I think that technology would make us smarter, but I think it would also make us much more lazy and make us have less personal connections with each other. I think that technology will decrease human interaction and human understanding resulting in mental issues among other problems. I believe that his prediction will be wrong. I think it will take much longer for AI to fully understand human language. I think that AI will get better at utilizing information, but they still won’t be able to connect with humans.
