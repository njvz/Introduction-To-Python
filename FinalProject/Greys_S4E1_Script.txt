I'm in love with you,George,and
I hope you're in love with me,too.


I was named chief resident.






I've failed my intern test.


You can start from the very beginning.


Repeat my internship?


- I met a woman last night.
- Hi.


You met a woman last night?


I'm lexie.Lexie grey.


he's gone.


I can't leave you,but
you're constantly leaving me.


It's over...so over.

in the practice of
medicine,change is inevitable






new surgical techniques are
created,procedures are updated


levels of expertise increase.


Innovation is everything.


Nothing remains the same for long.


We either adapt to change...


or we get left behind.


I have five rules.Memorize them.


Rule number one,don't bother sucking up.


I already hate you.That's
not gonna change.


Trauma protocols,phone
lists,pagers.The nurses will page you.


You answer every page at a run--
a run.That's rule number two.


You're supposed to follow me.


Your first shift starts
now and lasts 36 hours.


You're grunts,nobodies,the
bottom of the surgical food chain.


You run labs,you write orders,you
work every second night until you drop,


and you don't complain.


On call rooms.Sleep when
you can,where you can.


You know,but not with anybody.


Not attendings--
especially not attendings.


Sleeping with attendings--
not a good idea.


Where was I?


Um,rule number three.


If you're sleeping,do not wake you
unless a patient's actually dying.


The dying patient better
not be dead when I get there,


because not only will
you have killed someone,


you will have woken me for
no good reason.Are we clear?


- yes?
- That was four rules.You said five.


Rule number five--
when I move,you move.


Go!


I hate them.you don't
hate them.You hate you.


That was hideous.I feel like a fraud.


I rocked it.I think I'm the new nazi.


Oh,you are not the new nazi.


Meredith,I need to talk to you.


- George.Hi.
- Hey.


- How was your vacation?
- Um,fine.


- Um,meredith,can we
- 'cause mine was...


I didn't do much.I hung
out alone...for 17 days.


Which is the last time that I saw you,


the day of cristina's
wedding,which was...well...


then mer and cristina went on
cristina's honeymoon without me.


Girl-on-girl
honeymoon.


and then alex took a road
trip to see ava without me.


I did not go to see
ava.And her name's rebecca.


And I didn't go see her.I
just drove in that direction.


Oh,why is everyone so tingly and hurt?


I mean,I'm the one who
was left at the altar.


I'm fine,by the way.


I honeymooned in hawaii and I snorkled.


What'd you do,george?


- Um,meredith... - I-I
really need to talk to you.


Uh,hey,you
want to know--


hey,um,this is for
residents only.No interns.


- Yeah.
- Yeah,get outta here.


- babies.
- yeah,go away.


007s in traini.


seriously.


I guess I should be going,too.


no,george.We didn't mean you.


- No,I'm an inrn.
- Wait.What did you want to tell me?


Uh,is this how it's gonna be all year?


Because bambi has got
to learn how to cope.


At least he came back.


yeah,cut him some slack.


Dude,he failed his exam and
got left back in kindergarten.


Mm-hmm.


He won't even look at me.


Have you seen burke?


No.Have you seen derek?


No.


Wait,you haven't seen either
of them since the wedding?


nope.


And you're all fine?


- yep
- Wow..


You're either incredibly
healthy or completely messed up.


your interns are back
from holiday today.


Uh,not my interns.They're
residents.I'm free.


Right.Well--here,nurse.The
point is,uh,dr.Yang.


The burke thing--
she doesn't know.


I'm supposed to tell her.


Burke asked me to tell her.Any thoughts?


- Honesty always works best.
- Yeah,that's true.


You want to get together for
a drink after work tonight?


- Why?
- Well,I don't know.


I just thought it might be a
good idea to get together and have


oh,you don't have anybody to talk to.


No,I have people to talk to.


Addison is gone,burke isn't around,


and you and grey aren't smelling
each other in the elevators anymore.


- I have people to talk to.
- Who?


I have...chief.


I-I have the chief
to talk to.Hey,chief.


Want to get together
for a drink after work?


I don't drink.Dr.Bailey,we need to talk.


- We have traumas coming in.
- You're avoiding me.We need to talk.


About you choosing dr.Torres to
be your chief resident over me?


Respectfully,no,sir.We're
not going to talk about that.


Someone mention a drink
later?'Cause I'm in.


- Nobody mentioned a drink.
- You mentioned a drink.


I did not mention a drink.


All right,people.We've got three M.V.C.S


rolling in back-to-back
from a multicar pileup.


We need every trauma room
open and everyone suited up.


Is there anything I-I should do,sir?


- Save lives.
- No.I mean as,uh,chief resident.


Anything in particular?


Make sure your residents
run their traumas.


This is their first day on their own.


Where...are the residents
you've assigned to this E.R.?


Oh.Oh,I,uh,I,uh,I paged
them.I-- I paged them.


- Bailey?
- What?


Uh,I,uh,paged,uh,grey,yang,stevens
and karev,but they're not here yet.


When I page 'em,they come running.


Get it together,torres.


Yes,sir.


Okay,you did not have to say
that in front of the chief.


You asked...boss.


There's derek.


- Is burke with him?
- I don't see him.


Where have you been?We have
multiple M.V.C.S due any second.

Just-- just get ready,okay?And
monitor your interns.


Okay,one,two,go get stat packs.


Uh,three,four,go meet the ambulances.


- "One and two"?
- No,I can't remember their names.


I don't respond to
being called a number.


George,go wait for the ambulance.


The rest of you come with me.


All right,you guys stand against the wall
and out of the way unless I call for you.


Okay,this is what's
called a trauma situation.


So there's gonna be lots of
activity and a lot of patients,


so if you guys have any
questions at all,just ask,okay?

killed a guy and had to go on probation.

There's a chance at
a good recovery here.


Do we have an arm?


They're looking for it.


My baby has no father.He's

I'd kill for something to eat.


A healthy appetite
after a trauma like this?


That's a very good sign,joey.


You think he'll need surgery?


That depends on the x-rays.

She's working.

So any chance you wanna
let me in on this?Please.

You're gonna be,like,the
rock star intern.


Yeah,I'm sure that's how everyone's

Michael,it is a deer.


We're gonna take her home and
skin her and freeze the meat,okay?


What?Why?!

I don't like you.


You don't like me because of meredith?


I don't like you because you're you.


Hmm.How is meredith,by the way?


Is she okay?


She's fine.


She's always fine.That's her problem.


We're fine people.We do fine.We're fine.


How's dr.Burke?I
haven't seen him around.


Is--is he
off today?


Here.


Dr.Burke handed in his letter
of resignation two weeks ago.


He wanted me to tell you.


He's g-gone?


I'm sorry.


- Well,don't be.I'm
- fine?


Yeah.


- Circulatory system of a deer?
- Shut up.


Oh,dr.Bailey.


Uh,couldn't you use an extra
set of hands in the O.R.Today?


I saw an appy on the
board.I'm--I'm great at appys.


Talk to torres.She's in
charge of what cas you get now.


It's hard to set a shattered kneecap
when your patient's in the pit,


don't you think?


whatever.


I don't know how you did it.


Did what?


Get 'em to listen to you,to
give you some respect.


Hey,dr.Bailey,you wouldn't happen to know anything about,


uh,the anatomy of a deer?


Not my intern,not my business,not anymore.


Your husband's injuries are s-severe.


Uh,they're traumatic in the extreme.


I'm sorry.What does that mean?


The only thing holding his head on to his body is skin and muscle.


If he moves even a fraction of an inch,it could kill him.


S-so are you saying that the--


I'm--I'm saying that when you see him,this could be the last time--


this could be the last time you see him alive.


are you in pain,sweetie?


Good.


Two blinks-- you aren't in pain.


Why isn't daddy answering?


Just-- right now we just need to wish daddy good luck in his surgery


and tell him how much we love him.Okay?


'cause we do.


I love you so much,henry.


What's--what's three blinks?


Uh,we've only been working with one and two.


Is it "I love you"?


Are you telling us you love us?


three blinks is I love you.


We're gonna be fine,henry.


You're gonna make it,and we're all gonna be just fine.


it's time to go.


Okay,guys.Let's let these doctors fix daddy up.


george.


George.


why are you avoiding me?


I'm on my way to surgery.


No,I don't mean right now.I mean.


not one word i17 days?


I tell you that I love you,and not one word?Where have you been?


I've been right here.


You know where? Exactly where I was a year ago.


I'm sorry.


I--I'm freaking out.


I'm an intern again.


Yeah,we're all freaking out.


We're all freaking out.


I'm in charge of a group of
interns who think I'm crazy.


And I might actually be crazy,
because day one of me being in charge,


and I'm obsessed with rescuing bambi.


We're all freaking out.


Since when did you start calling me bambi?


- What?
- I'm not calling you bambi.


No,I mean,I know I-I-- I under--
I expect it from cristina or alex,


- but-
- I'm bambi.


I'm bambi,george,okay?


If anyone in this situation is a sad
little cartoon character,it's me.


I'm all alone in the forest--
all alone in the forest,george--


and my mother's been shot by a hunter,
and where are you?


Where the hell are you?


I'm on my way to surgery.


I really am up for a drink,you know?


If you,uh,need to talk.


What would i need to talk about?


Meredith.


You were lucky,man.


That girl jerked you around.


You have no idea what you're talking about.


Hey,I'm just.


seemed like you could use a friend about now.


Meredith's mother never wanted her.


and her father was never man
enough to hang around.


She has a right to be damaged,
and us,together,it's a big step for her.


Her best friend gets left on the altar,


and all she sees now is things
like this,they don't work.


She panics.


She wants this.


She doesn't know how to have it.


And you know what?


That's not her fault.


So don't ever talk to me
about meredith grey again,


because you do not know
what you're talking about.


And I don't need a friend.


Okay,nancy,I want you to count back
from a hundred,okay?


No.


No.I'm not ready.


It's just like going to sleep.


I can't do any of this alone.


I don't want to be alone anymore.


I know.


- No,I'm scared.
- I know.


I am scared,meredith.


I know.


I think it's very brave,what you're doing.


It's much better to be alone and feel
like a success than to be in a relationship


and feel like a failure all the time,right?


That's what I think.


So let's just take care of your arm,
and then we'll deal with the rest later,okay?


Well,it looks like I'm back to babysitting.


What the hell? Who took my clamps
and the bandage scissors?


joey?


there's a foreign body.


His abdomen's rigid.


Somebody page dr.Bailey right now.


Go!


Come on,joey.


you like hamburgers,don't you?


Yeah.


And spaghetti with meatballs,and lasagna?


Mm-hmm.


That's beef.


That's cow you're eating,son.


What do you mean?


Could we have the "circle of life" lesson later?


I need to get in here.


Sorry.


her eyes are glassy.


You,get in here and ventilate.


We're losing her.


This is absolutely childish and ridiculous.


No,it's not.


It's not childish to hold on to hope.


It's actually hard-- very,very hard.


Your son just wants to believe that
some things can work out for the best.


Get me the paddles.


Come on,come on,come on.


What's she doing?


Insuring we never see the inside of
an O.R.This year?


she's in v-fib.I'm gonna shock.


Charge to 300 and stand back.


okay,clear.


oh,my god.


Oh,my god.She's alive?


It worked.She's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.


oh,my god.


Got a big bleeder.


Dr.Grey,press and hold right here.


she's having contractions.


Well,take a look,george.


Probably the stress.


No,these are strong,and they're
two minutes apart.


call O.B.And get someone in here.


Uh,I don't think there's time to call O.B.


Her water just broke,and she's crowning.


Call peds.Get a warmer in here.


This baby's coming now.


O'malley,get her up in stirrups.


Can we put her in a reverse trendelenburg,


have one of the nurses press
her abdomen since she can't push?


Try it without all the jostling.


I'm holding on to a major artery here.


Okay,clamp.


Scissors.


I got it.


I got him.


great job,george.


Thanks.


yeah,yeah,we're all heroes.


Now if no one minds,I'd like to get
this woman's arm sewn on.


like she said,she's gonna need it.


I'm starting the fusion now.


Did.


he just move?


oh,he d-- he definitely moved.


The anesthesia's light.


- Yang,stabilize his neck.
- okay,three,come and grab his feet.


Go under the drape and do not
contaminate the sterile field.


we need to keep him
very still until he is under.


We can't risk even the slightest movement.


You cannot move.


Do you hear me?


This is not an option.


Everything is not gonna be fine if you move.


It will be the opposite of fine.


You cannot leave the people you love.
They need you.


not just the memory that you love them.


Anyone care to explain to me how
my patient wound up in this O.R.


And I wasn't even informed?


Karev?


dr.Karev didn't page you because he
knows how to prioritize.


Ten minutes ago,this patient was
coding from a perfed abdomen.


Under the circumstances,


dr.Karev's quick thinking is the reason
that your patient is even still alive.


I'll expect a fully dictated chart before
you leave tonight,karev.


Ah,jackpot.


Did he swallow those?


Poor fool.He must suffer from pica,


an uncontrollable urge to eat any and everything.


Check it out-- a buffalo nickel.


Dr.Bailey,I saw you were scrubbed in.


I thought I'd stop by and see what you've got.


What I've got?


$2.37,sir.in change.


it like a cute festival in here.


I delivered that one an hour ago.


Oh,my god.


W-- why aren't you,like,jumping up and down?


I've done this before.


This is d?j?


look,george,you didn't pass your intern test.


You know,it--it happens.


It's--it's nobody's fault.


Right?


It's nobody's fault.


Yeah,it's just that callie gave cristina the study cards,


and meredith didn't write anything down,
and cristina was planning a wedding,and izzie--


izzie just had to.


you know,I'm--I'm-- I'm responsible.


I've always been the responsible one.


I'm not saying,"what about me?"


I'm not saying,"when do I get what I want?


"When do I get to be someone
other than the guy who repeats his intern year?"


- I'm not saying that,but-
- but what about you?


Yeah!


I didn't plan on being here.


I was all set for an internship at mass gen.


And then.


my mother gets the hiccups,
and I'm at a funeral.


You know,we all have problems.


Mo die,and dads drink so much that they
don't even know what year they're in,and sisters--I--


I didn't even know that there was a
meredith grey until a couple of months ago.


And she won't--she doesn't
even want to talk to me.


I don't want to be here.


You know,I.


I'd giving anything to not be here.


You know,to--to have my life work
out the way I planned,


to even have time to ask,
"what about me?"


So you--you change.


You--you get over it.


I'm here now,so.


and you.


you delivered a baby today.


So.


stop feeling sorry for yourself.


You.


are kind of awesome.


I know.


**Psych's prepared to consult on the patient?


Thank you.


Now whether you like it or not,
you and I are gonna talk.


- Chief-
- I know you're angry and disappointed.


No,I'm not angry.


I'm not disappointed.


I'm speechless.


I don't want to talk because I am speechless.


It makes me speechless to realize
you didn't think that.


I would've made an-- an excellent chief resident.


You're right.


You would've made an excellent chief resident.


But you'll make an even more excellent surgeon.


You belong in the O.R.,Bailey.


Focus on honing those skills,


not on how well you can juggle
schedules or fill out paperwork.


Believe me,I know.


You'll thank me for this one day.


But not today.


I'm the one that could use a friend.


I said that you could use a friend.
I could use a friend.


Look,mark--
no,I didn't come to seattle for addison.


I didn't come to seattle to be chief.


I came to seattle for you,okay?


I came to seattle to get you back.


I know.I want to take it back now,
but I already said it,so.


maybe we should have a drink.


We could.


Yeah.Not today.


I know you didn't wake up this morning
expecting this was how your first day was gonna go.


You thought you'd get to reattach an arm
or observe brain surgery.


Instead you helped save the life of a deer.


You can bitch and complain about it,
or you can adjust your expectations.


'Cause like it or not,you're stuck with me.


And I'm the kind of doctor who lets a little
kid convince her she can do the impossible.


Oh,plus,when I woke uphis morning,
I thought today was gonna go a lot differently,too.


I thought I was gonna get the good interns.


Instead I get stuck with the duds.


So I have to adjust my expectations as well.


- What?
- We heard--


we heard you delivered a baby today.


On your very first day as an intern.


Yeah.


- what was it like?
- did you do it all by yourself?


Was it just like-- did your head just
explode with the amazingness?


Your very first day.


It was pretty cool.


He came out really fast.


I had to,uh.


you know,determine the position of the cord.


You know what a reverse trendelenburg is?


I filled this entire bag with coins from my
patient's stomach today.


No kidding?


I miss rebecca.


I miss burke.


Want some money?


Change.


we don't like it,we fear it.


what?


You want to humiliate me some more?


'Cause I get it.I suck.


I suck at my job.


I suck as a wife.


I suck all around,so.


go ahead.Humiliate me some more,please.


Hope tomorrow's better.


But we can't stop it from coming.


meredith.


meredith.


We either adapt to change.


or we get left behind.


I,uM.


you're not ready for


no.


I asked for too much.


I think so.


So this is it?


Yeah.


We're breaking up.


We're breaking up.


It hurts to grow.


Anybody who tells you it doesn't is lying.


We're broken up.


It's done.


so a breakup kiss.


A breakup kiss.


And some breakup sex.


Yeah,breakup sex.


But here's the truth.


sometimes the more things change,
the more they stay the same.


and sometimes--
oh,sometimes change is good.


I love you,too.


Sometimes change is.


everything.
